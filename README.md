# Password Generator - UC Berkeley Fullstack Bootcamp

This password generator is a project developed as part of the UC Berkeley Fullstack Bootcamp. It is a tool that enables the generation of strong and secure passwords according to customizable criteria. Feel free to use the generated passwords for your own accounts!

## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to be able to randomly generate a password that meets specific criteria, enabling the creation of a robust password that provides a higher level of security.

## Acceptance Criteria

Success for this project is defined by the following criteria:

- **Password generation process**: When I click the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- **Password criteria selection**: When prompted, I can select which criteria to include in the password.
- **Password length**: I can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters for the password.
- **Character type inclusion**: I am asked for the types of characters to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters) and can confirm whether or not to include them.
- **Input validation**: When I answer each prompt, my input is validated, and at least one character type should be selected.
- **Password generation**: After all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- **Password display**: Once the password is generated, it is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

Please remember that stronger passwords typically include a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters and have a length of at least 8 characters.
